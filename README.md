# Responsive Design Project

Personal project for a fictional cake website, built with HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. Created in order to practice responsive design, making use of media queries and FlexBox.

## Live Site:


Built using HTML, CSS and some basic JavaScript, this was my first solo project intended as a way to practice my skills. I also wanted to create a responsive website without relying on Bootstrap, and used Flexbox and media queries to achieve this.
