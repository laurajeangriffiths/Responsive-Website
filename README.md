# Responsive Design Project

Personal project for a fictional cake website, built with HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. Created in order to practice responsive design, making use of media queries and FlexBox.

Built using HTML, CSS and some basic JavaScript, this was my first personal project intended to practice my skills. I also wanted to create a responsive website without relying on Bootstrap, and used Flexbox and media queries to achieve this. This was my first experience working with responsive concepts, and my first solo project.
